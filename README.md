# Detecting-Click-Fraud-in-Online-Advertising

<p>Targeted content is provided to consumers by a multitude of parties in the extensive online advertising ecosystem, including publishers, ad networks, advertisers, and advertising services. Using demand-side platforms (DSPs) for accurate audience targeting, advertisers generate advertisements that are submitted to advertising providers. Conversely, publishers sell ad space and show advertising to viewers who are relevant to them by using supply-side platforms (SSPs). Specifically, this study employs the TalkingData Ad Tracking Fraud Detection (TDA) dataset to assess how much data-level sampling techniques improve classifier performance in the highly unbalanced user-click dataset environment. In order to prevent click fraud and safeguard the integrity of digital advertising campaigns, comprehensive analysis is intended to yield practical insights.

As internet technology has advanced, the landscape of digital advertising has changed dramatically, shifting from conventional media to online and in-app ads. For internet behemoths like Facebook, Google, and Yahoo, who have cemented their status as significant participants in online advertising, this change has been especially advantageous. But in addition to the advantages that digital advertising offers, click fraud has become a major problem for industry players. The legitimacy of the online advertising ecosystem is threatened by click fraud, which is defined as misleading click actions intended to deceive advertisers and redirect advertising income. Skewed datasets and changing user behaviour make addressing this problem more difficult, calling for creative ways to improve fraud detection systems.
